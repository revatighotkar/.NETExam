--1.Write a T-SQL Program to generate complete payslip of a given employee with respect to the following condition
--a)	HRA  as 10% Of sal
--b)	DA as  20% of sal
--c)	PF as 8% of sal
--d)	IT as 5% of sal
--e)	Deductions as sum of PF and IT
--f)	Gross Salary as sum of SAL,HRA,DA and Deductions
--g)	Net salary as  Gross salary - Deduction 

begin
declare @salary float = 45000;
declare @SAL float,@HRA float,@PF float, @DA float,@IT float
declare @Deductions float, @GrossSAlary float, @NetSalary float

--a)HRA  as 10% Of sal

set @HRA = ((@salary)*10/100)
print 'HRA Salary is : ' + '  ' +  cast(@HRA as varchar(10))


--b)DA as  20% of sal 

set @DA =((@salary)*20/100)
print 'DA Salary is : '+''+cast(@DA as varchar(10))

--c)PF as 8% of sal
set @PF =((@salary)*8/100)
print 'PF Salary is : '+''+cast(@PF as varchar(10))


--d)IT as 5% of sal
set @IT =((@salary)*5/100)
print 'IT Salary is : '+''+cast(@IT as varchar(10))


--e)Deductions as sum of PF and IT
set @Deductions = @PF+@IT
print 'Deductions is : '+''+cast(@Deductions as varchar(10))


--f)Gross Salary as sum of SAL,HRA,DA and Deductions
set @SAL = @salary - (@HRA + @DA + @Deductions)
set @GrossSAlary = @SAL + (@HRA+  @DA + @Deductions)
print 'Gross Salary is : '+''+cast(@GrossSAlary as varchar(10))


--g)Net salary as  Gross salary- Deduction
set @NetSalary = @GrossSAlary-@Deductions
print 'Net Salary is : '+''+cast(@NetSalary as varchar(10))
end

--2.Write a T-SQL Program to find the factorial of a given number.

begin
	declare @num int
	declare @factorial int
	set @num=5
	set @factorial=1
while @num>0
	begin
		set @factorial=@factorial*@num
		set @num=@num-1
	end
	print 'Factorial of a given Number is : '+cast(@factorial as varchar)
	
end

--3.Create a stored procedure to generate multiplication tables up to a given number.

create or alter proc Multiplication_Table(@num1 int)
as
begin
 declare @num2 int = 1, @result int
  
  while(@num2<=10)
  begin
    set @result = @num1 * @num2
print @result
set @num2 = @num2 + 1
  end
  end
Exec Multiplication_Table @num1 = 6
